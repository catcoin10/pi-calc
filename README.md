# pi-calc
This is a python program that tries to find numbers where the amount of accurate data about pi encoded in a given fraction exceeds such approximation. Only known example: 355 / 113.

<!-- There is (probably) no hope of finding a number other than (355/113) where the number of digits *in a fraction, both numerator and denominator* exceeds that information encoded. -->

With this program, we can try to find numbers where the amount of accurate information encoded about pi in a fraction (yes we can go below integers for this metric) exceeds the amount in that given amount of information in the number ITSELF.

We have tried every (prime) number up to 324,407,773 so far.
